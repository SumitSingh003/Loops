Here, the transasction throws an error if gas limit is 300k so I put it to 3 millions.
Also, gas price for the complex loop with less (100) iterations is almost 7 time greater than that of the simple loop with greater (1000) iterations.
The simple loop is for getting the sum of 1000 numbers.
The complex loop was to find the fibonacci series upto 100th place
